During the course, I gained a better understanding of the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)'s eight security domains, as well as distinct security frameworks and controls. I got an introduction to utilizing security tools and conducting audits as a means of safeguarding assets and data. The cybersecurity industry widely recognizes these concepts as fundamental, and understanding them is crucial for protecting organizations and their stakeholders against potential threats, hazards, and susceptibilities. At the end of the course, I got the opportunity to conduct an internal audit for a fictional company, Biotium Toys. In this activity, I analyzed the organization's audit scope, goals, and risk assessment. During the audit, I conducted a control assessment by reviewing the list of Botium Toys' assets, examining each control's name, analyzing its types and explanations, marking an "X" next to each control that requires implementation, and noting the priority levels (high, medium, and/or low; NA if not applicable).

I conducted a compliance checklist as part of the internal audit process. In light of the hypothetical company's situation, I took into account the geographical locations where the company operates and the methods by which they receive payments from their clientele. In addition, I provided an explanation as to why it is imperative for the company to comply with the chosen regulations and standards.

<h4>Project description:</h4>

During this project, I conducted a comprehensive assessment of Botium Toys' cybersecurity programme. The audit aimed to ensure that current business practices are in line with industry standards and best practices. The purpose of the audit was to offer mitigation recommendations for high-risk vulnerabilities identified and to present a comprehensive strategy for enhancing the organisation's security posture. I was required to thoroughly document findings, develop comprehensive remediation plans, and effectively communicate with all relevant stakeholders.
